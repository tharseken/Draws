# Steps

### Note: Make sure all files (python script, processIDs, carrier map) are all in the same folder/directory.

Step 1: Download this script and carrier map. Make updates to the carrier map if necessary.

Step 2: Download the ProcessID files from Dart (Route Planning -> Route Restructure Results -> Download Locations) for all plants

Step 3: Run the python script. It will output a `.csv` file. You can open this in Excel to make it look prettier.
